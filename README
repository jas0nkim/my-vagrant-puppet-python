[Description]

Python installed Debian instance.
Debian(squeeze 32bit) + python 2.6.6 (option: + virtualenv + Django 1.4)

** For Django installation **
You may install Django in virtualenv. Please install with following steps:
Step 1) setuptools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/)
Step 2) virtualenv (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/)
Step 3) django (https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)

The install files are in /utils directory

When starting a web server use follow command to be accessible from anywhere
python manage.py runserver [::]:8000

So you can simply run the web application from your browser
ex. http://localhost:8999 (forwarded port)
